# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
_Context_

_It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase._

*Three algorithms will be used and their results will be compared for classification*

1. Isolation Forest Algorithm
2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) Algorithm
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Isolation Forest Algorithm and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) Algorithm are two algorithms which are specially used in classification problems when the dataset is highly biased
